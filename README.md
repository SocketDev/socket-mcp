<details><summary><b>Manual Installation Instructions & more MCP Clients</b></summary>

<details><summary><b>Install in Claude Desktop or Claude Code</b></summary>

> [!NOTE]
> Custom integrations are not available to all paid versions of Claude. Check [here](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11175166-about-custom-integrations-using-remote-mcp) for more information.

To use the public Socket MCP server with Claude Desktop:

1. In Claude Desktop, go to Settings > Developer > Edit Config.

2. Add the Socket MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "socket-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.socket.dev/"
    }
  }
}
```

3. Save the configuration and restart Claude Desktop.

4. Now you can ask Claude questions like "Check the security score for express version 4.18.2".

The process is similar for Claude Code. See the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp) for more details. Here's an example command to add the Socket MCP server:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http socket-mcp https://mcp.socket.dev/
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>Install in VS Code</b></summary>

You can install the Socket MCP server using the VS Code CLI:

```bash
# For VS Code with GitHub Copilot
code --add-mcp '{"name":"socket-mcp","type":"http","url":"https://mcp.socket.dev/}'
```

After installation, the Socket MCP server will be available for use with your GitHub Copilot agent in VS Code.

Alternatively, you can manually add it to your VS Code MCP configuration in `.vscode/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "socket-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.socket.dev/"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>Install in Cursor</b></summary>

Go to `Cursor Settings` -> `MCP` -> `Add new MCP Server`. Name it "socket-mcp", use `http` type with URL `https://mcp.socket.dev/`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "socket-mcp": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://mcp.socket.dev/"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>Install in Windsurf</b></summary>

> [!WARNING]
> Windsurf does not support `http` type MCP servers yet. Use the `stdio` configuration [below](#option-2a-stdio-mode-default).

To use the Socket MCP server in Windsurf:

1. Open Windsurf Settings
2. Navigate to MCP Servers section
3. Add a new server with the following configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "socket-mcp": {
            "serverUrl": "https://mcp.socket.dev/mcp"
        }
    }
}
```

4. Save the configuration and restart Windsurf if needed.

### Option 2: Deploy Socket MCP Server on your machine

If you prefer to run your own instance, you can deploy the Socket MCP server locally using either stdio or HTTP modes.

### Getting an API key

To use a local Socket MCP Server, you need to create an API key. You can do this by following [these steps](https://docs.socket.dev/reference/creating-and-managing-api-tokens). The only required permission scope is `packages:list`, which allows the MCP server to query package metadata for dependency scores.

For local deployment, you have two options:

##### Option 2a: Stdio Mode (Default)

Click a button below to install the self-hosted stdio server in your favorite AI assistant.

[![Install in VS Code](https://img.shields.io/badge/VS_Code-Socket_MCP-0098FF?style=flat-square&logo=visualstudiocode&logoColor=white)](https://vscode.dev/redirect/mcp/install?name=socket-mcp&config={"command":"npx","args":["@socketsecurity/mcp@latest"],"type":"stdio"})
[![Install in Cursor (stdio)](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-dark.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=socket-mcp-stdio&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IiwiYXJncyI6WyJAc29ja2V0c2VjdXJpdHkvbWNwQGxhdGVzdCJdLCJlbnYiOnsiU09DS0VUX0FQSV9LRVkiOiJ5b3VyLWFwaS1rZXktaGVyZSJ9fQ==)

Claude Code (stdio mode) can be set up with the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add socket-mcp -e SOCKET_API_KEY="your-api-key-here" -- npx -y @socketsecurity/mcp@latest
```
This is how the configuration looks like on most MCP clients:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "socket-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@socketsecurity/mcp@latest"],
      "env": {
        "SOCKET_API_KEY": "your-api-key-here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This approach automatically uses the latest version without requiring global installation.


##### Option 2b: HTTP Mode

1. Run the server in HTTP mode using npx:
   ```bash
   MCP_HTTP_MODE=true SOCKET_API_KEY=your-api-key npx @socketsecurity/mcp@latest --http
   ```

2. Configure your MCP client to connect to the HTTP server:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "socket-mcp": {
         "type": "http",
         "url": "http://localhost:3000"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Tools exposed by the Socket MCP Server

### depscore

The `depscore` tool allows AI assistants to query the Socket API for dependency scoring information. It provides comprehensive security and quality metrics for packages across different ecosystems.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `packages` | Array | ‚úÖ Yes | - | Array of package objects to analyze |
| `packages[].ecosystem` | String | No | `"npm"` | Package ecosystem (`npm`, `pypi`, `cargo`, etc.) |
| `packages[].depname` | String | ‚úÖ Yes | - | Name of the dependency/package |
| `packages[].version` | String | No | `"unknown"` | Version of the dependency |

**Example Usage:**

```json
{
  "packages": [
    {
      "ecosystem": "npm",
      "depname": "express",
      "version": "4.18.2"
    },
    {
      "ecosystem": "pypi",
      "depname": "fastapi",
      "version": "0.100.0"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Sample Response:**
```
pkg:npm/express@4.18.2: supply_chain: 1.0, quality: 0.9, maintenance: 1.0, vulnerability: 1.0, license: 1.0
pkg:pypi/fastapi@0.100.0: supply_chain: 1.0, quality: 0.95, maintenance: 0.98, vulnerability: 1.0, license: 1.0
```

### How to Use the Socket MCP Server

1. **Ask your AI assistant** to check dependencies:
   - "Check the security score for express version 4.18.2"
   - "Analyze the security of my package.json dependencies"
   - "What are the vulnerability scores for react, lodash, and axios?"

2. **Get comprehensive security insights** including supply chain, quality, maintenance, vulnerability, and license scores.

### Adjust tool usage with custom rules

You can further customize how the Socket MCP server interacts with your AI assistant by modifying your client rules. The rules are usually a markdown file and its location depends on the AI assistant you are using.

| MCP Client | Rules File Location |
|---|---|
| Claude Desktop/Code | `CLAUDE.md`  |
| VSCode Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`  |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules` |


Rules that can be added to the client rules file include the following:

```md
Always check dependency scores with the depscore tool when you add a new dependency. If the score is low, consider using an alternative library or writing the code yourself. If you are unsure about the score, ask for a review from someone with more experience. When checking dependencies, make sure to also check the imports not just the pyproject.toml/package.json/dependency file.
```

You can adjust the rules to fit your needs. For example, you can add rules to include specific manifest files, or guide the AI assistant on how to handle low scores. The rules are flexible and can be tailored to your workflow.


## Development

### For End Users

For most users, we recommend using either:
1. **Public server**: `https://mcp.socket.dev/` (no setup required)
2. **NPX command**: `npx @socketsecurity/mcp@latest` (always latest version)

### For Contributors

If you want to contribute to the Socket MCP server development:

### Health Check Endpoint

When running in HTTP mode, the server provides a health check endpoint for Kubernetes and Docker deployments:

```bash
GET /health
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "socket-mcp",
  "version": "0.0.3",
  "timestamp": "2025-06-17T20:45:22.059Z"
}
```

This endpoint can be used for:
- Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes
- Docker health checks
- Load balancer health monitoring
- General service monitoring
